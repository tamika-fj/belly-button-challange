Module 14 belly-button-challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called belly button challenge wich contains a folder called Starter_Code, this has a chrome HTML file that will take you to the interactive belly vutton dashboard. Additionally there iis a samples JSON file which contains the raw data for the assignment. There is a js folder within the static folder that contains the javascript file app. This has all the code to run the index HTML for the assignment. The Javascript file is annotated for ease of reading and understanding. To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. To add all the metadata values to the panel on the dashboard I learned the Objectect.entries function from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries. To create the bar and bubble charts I consulted the plotly website for examples of how to execute the code, https://plotly.com/javascript/bar-charts/#colored-and-styled-bar-chart, https://plotly.com/python/bubble-charts/, https://plotly.com/javascript/colorscales/#electric-colorscale. I learnt the code to read in the JSON file from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/d3-js-json-function/.
